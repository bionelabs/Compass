# Estimation Guidelines

We use the Fibonacci-based scale 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 to estimate feature stories.

When assigning points to a user story, we follow the multi-faceted guideline hereafter:

0 point: no complexity, no unknowns. The effort required is usually less than an hour, e.g. change of text or image.
1 point: no complexity, no unknowns. The effort required is usually between a couple of hours and one day.
2 points: no complexity (as-in “it’s something I have done before”) but it takes more time to implement than a two-point story. So the effort required is usually around 1-2 days.
3 points: medium complexity due to having some unknowns and needs for research. So developers probably know how to do 50% of it only. The effort required is usually between 2-3 days.
5 points: high complexity due to having lots of unknowns because either it requires lots of research or because developers have never done it before. The effort required is usually between 3-5 days.
8 points: indicative that the story is too complex or large, thus needs to be re-worked and broken down into smaller stories.
